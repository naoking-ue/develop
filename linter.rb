# This is a script to lint one or more files for common errors.
# It's ideal for using as part of a git pre-commit hook; use the following to set up the hook:
#     ln -s -f ../../linter.rb .git/hooks/pre-commit
# It can also be run manually, and takes file names (relative to the git root) as parameters.
# The script checks for the following, and exits with a non-zero status if any condition fails:
# - a successful Jekyll site build
# - for each file, that all boilerplate content has been removed
# - for each file, that the templated version of it under _site/ passes JSHint

# We need at least one file name as a parameter.
files = ARGV.clone
if files.length == 0
  files = `git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM`.split("\n")
end
fail('No files found in git diff, nor provided as command line parameters.') unless files.length > 0

# Bail out if we can't perform a Jekyll site build.
output = `bundle exec jekyll build`
